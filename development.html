<h2>Our philosophy is: <em>make it simple stupid!</em></h2>
<p>
	But what does that mean?<br/>
	It means, write just enough code to make it work.<br/>
	Ok, no problem. But what happens when you want (and you will) a few extra bells and whistles?<br/>
	Then things get a bit complex.<br/>
</p>
<p>
	So what do we do at GanaptiWeb?<br/>
	<b><em>Use your Frameworks people!</em></b>
</p>
<p>Software frameworks are tools written by very smart people who realized that abstracting the repetitive and technical nature of software development would let them, and their fellow developers, focus on what an application or website does, and not how it does it.</p>
<p>
	<ul>Our favorites software tools:
		<li><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Even though these babies do completely different things (rapid app development, javascript magic, beautiful and easy styling, etc) we use them in our projects in order to save time (headaches too!) and deliver cutting-edge sites and applications.</p>

<p>These tools allow us, or even your own developer, to easily upgrade and extend your website, using standards that any "good" developer/designer understands without breaking the bank or fearing your site will soon become obsolete with newer trends.</p>
<p>
	<ul>Our favorite software solutions:
		<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Mediawiki</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://refinerycms.com/">Refinery</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://spreecommerce.com/">Spree</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>These are ready-to-go packages that allow you to get started right away: blogging/publishing, collaborating, e-commerce, etc. They can be easily customized to fit your needs and visual taste.</p>
